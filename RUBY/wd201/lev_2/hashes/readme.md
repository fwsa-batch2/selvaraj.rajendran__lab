 <h1> hashes</h1>
```
To recap what we did in this code:

    We can initialize an empty hash with {}
    To add a new element to a hash, use the syntax: hash[key] = value
    The values of a hash can be other objects - like arrays, or even other hashes
    We can get an array of all the keys in a hash with the .keys method
    When we iterate over a Hash with .each or .map, we get both the key and its value on each iteration.
